Longest Consecutive Sequence in Binary tree
Given a binary tree. Find the length of the longest path which comprises of nodes with consecutive values in increasing order.
Every node is considered as a path of length 1.

The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.

Note: The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).

For Example

Input 1:
                2
               /  \
              3    1
             / \ 
            4  5
Output 1:
    3
    Explanation 1:
        Longest consecutive path is 2 - 3 - 4.

Input 2:
                2
                \
                 3
                / 
               2
              /
              1     
Output 2:
     2
     Explanation 2:
        Longest consecutive path is 2  - 3.
